# MySharedPointer

Project consist of 2 libraries, each containing one class, and short executable program for manual testing.
1st library contains my own implementation of std::shared_ptr.
2nd library helps implements flyweight pattern using templates, with sort of garbage collector, which deletes all unused objects each time, it's forced to create new one.
